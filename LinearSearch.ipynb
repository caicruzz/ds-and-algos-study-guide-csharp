    "#### Description\n",
    "The algorithm `LinearSearch` takes in an array of integers `input` and finds the index of the desired integer `searchTerm`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `input` does not contain the `searchTerm`, the function returns a `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Identify the first element of the array\n",
    "2. Compare whether the `searchTerm` is equal to identified value in the previous step.\n",
    "3. If the `searchTerm` is not equal to the value, move to the next element of the array.\n",
    "5. Repeat these steps until we have found the value, or we can't loop through the array any more."

    "1. Identify the first element: 5.\n",
    "2. Since 5 is not equal to 9 we move to the next element: [~~5~~,0,9,10,1].\n",

    "Arguably, if the value we are searching for is always located at index 0, then the algorithm would have a Big O notation of `O(1)` since it would be a single constant operation regardless of the size of `n`."
