    "## Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "A stack is a data structure that follows the *First In Last Out (FILO)* principle. Think of a stack of dirty plates. If you want to start washing them, it makes more sense to grab the plate at the top than the first plate you *stacked* at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "In the illustration bellow, block 8 would be the first plate you stacked and block 5 would be the last one you stacked. However, block 5 would be the first plate you wash, and block 8 would be the last one.\n",
    "![Stack Animation](../illustrations/stackgif.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations\n",
    "This data structure supports 3 major operations:\n",
    "1. Push (adding elements to the stack)\n",
    "2. Pop (removing elements from the stack)\n",
    "3. Peek (looking at the contents of the top element without removing it)\n",
    "\n",
    "`C#` and many popular languages have a built in stack implementation. For `C#` we have the `Stack` class. Don't quote me on this, but I am pretty sure many languages use a dynamically sized array under the hood to implement the Stack class. Below you can find a block of code that mimics the behavior of the dirty plates example above."
