    "## HashMap (Dictionary)\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "A hash map is a data structure that is useful when you want to map 2 values together. Think of the phonebook app on your phone. You probably have a record for family members or close friends. These combinations of the name and phone number are represented as `(key, value)` pairs in a hash map. The key would be the name of the person, and the value would be their phone number. Hash maps are really good at looking up information. Usually, they are a constant operation `O(1)`. Use them whenever you need to retreive lots of information in your algorithm. Luckily, `C#` has a built in class called `Dictionary` which essentially is a hash map.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations\n",
    "A hash map supports:\n",
    "1. Adding key-value pairs.\n",
    "2. Looking up a value by its key.\n",
    "3. Getting the total count of entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Some examples would be:\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <th>Name</th>\n",
    "        <th>Phone Number</th>\n",

    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <th>Mom</th>\n",
    "        <th>(000) 000-0000</th>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <th>Dad</th>\n",
