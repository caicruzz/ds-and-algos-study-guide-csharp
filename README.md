# Data Structures and Algorithms Study Guide in C#
I compiled this study guide to help me prepare for FAANG style technical interviews.

I used multiple sources to study, but some of my favorites are **(not sponsored)**:
- [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Guide-Structures-Algorithms-Second/dp/1680507222/ref=pd_lpo_1?pd_rd_i=1680507222&psc=1)
- [AlgoMonster](https://algo.monster/)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)

These are using the new [.NET Interactive Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

If you are not familiar with .NET Interative Notebooks, you can get up to speed [here](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive).

### How to Use This Guide.
I haven't put too much thought on a structure, but I would suggest starting with the section on DataStructures101. Then work your way through the Sorting section.

After that is pretty much up to you.

Happy CodingðŸ˜Ž!
